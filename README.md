## Superheroes Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
This project involves working with a modified version of the Superheroes dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to clean the dataset and combine the individual files into a final DataFrame. The final DataFrame should include the name of the hero, publisher, gender, eye color, race, hair color, height, skin color, alignment, weight, and one-hot-encoded columns for every power that appears in the dataset. Once the DataFrame is created, it will be used to answer two questions:

1. Compare the average weight of superpowers who have Super Speed to those who do not.
2. What is the average height of heroes for each publisher?

## Files
- superheroes_power_matrix.csv: a CSV file containing the power matrix for each superhero.
- superheroes.csv: a CSV file containing the attributes for each superhero.

## Requirements
- Python 3.0 or later
- Pandas Library
- Numpy Library

## Usage
1. Download the CSV files.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run the cells.

## Task Details
### I. Cleaning the Dataset
- Combining the two CSV files into one final DataFrame.
- Cleaning the DataFrame by removing any unnecessary columns.
- One-hot-encoding the power columns.
- Cleaning the data by removing any rows with null values.

### II. Analyzing the Dataset
1. Compare the average weight of superpowers who have Super Speed to those who do not.
2. What is the average height of heroes for each publisher?

## Conclusion
This project showcases how to clean and combine a dataset to make it suitable for analysis. It also demonstrates how to use the Pandas library in Python to analyze the dataset and answer questions about the data.
